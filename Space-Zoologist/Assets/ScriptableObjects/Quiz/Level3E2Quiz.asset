  - question: "Barry observed that a Stroteater\u2019s water need wasn\u2019t being

      to change the water\u2019s purity values, but it didn\u2019t help. What might
      you have done? Rank the following in order of best choice to worst choice:
      A. Make the water source bigger B. Check research on Stroteater\u2019s water
      needs. C. Test adding both salt water and stagnant water to see which works.\r\n"
