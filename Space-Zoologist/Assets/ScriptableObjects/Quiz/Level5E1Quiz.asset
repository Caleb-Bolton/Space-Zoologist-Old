  - question: Given that there is at least one population for every type of species
      present in the enclosure and all their needs are being satisfied, if the Mimi
      population started to decline what would be the most likely reason? Answer
      under the assumption that there is only one Mimi in the current population.

  - question: "Let\u2019s say you have to choose between two enclosures for a population
      of Mimi. Enclosure A contains a high amount of Astral Maple trees and one of
      every species population along with satisfiable water. Enclosure B contains
      a bit of every type of food source but is missing one type of species compared
      to enclosure A. Enclosure B also has satisfiable water. What do you predict
      will happen to the Mimi population in each enclosure over time assuming the
      population starts with only one Mimi?"
