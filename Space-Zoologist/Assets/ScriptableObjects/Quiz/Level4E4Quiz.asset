      needs were only partially satisfied, so she went ahead and placed more of the

  - question: 'Let''s say Juno designed an enclosure for a population of Flan. The
      enclosure contains plenty of appropriate purity water, an abundance of Bacca
      Berry Bushes, and mostly rocky terrain broken up by bits of swamp. Put the
      following choices in order of which will be most likely to negatively impact
      the population first according to the described enclosure: A. Not enough food
      B. Not enough comfortable terrain C. Water purity being too low.'

  - question: A researcher from another sector on Natura Serva is experiencing trouble
      maintaining a species from Planet DB, known as Meuhs. The literature on Meuhs
      is sparse, but the previous researcher can tell you that they prefer to eat
      Astral Maples and do best with freshwater. Which of the following would be
      the best test to conduct first in an effort to fill out the basics of the Meuh
      encyclopedia?

        present along with Astral Maples and fresh water.
