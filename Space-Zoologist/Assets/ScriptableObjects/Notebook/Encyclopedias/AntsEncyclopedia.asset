      title: Ecological Summary
      author: Formica Collis (Formite)
    text: "Similar to terran ants, Planet X was home to Formica Collis, colloquially
      dubbed \"Formites\". Formite hives conform to typical terran ant sizes, but
      diverge from terran ant color patterns, and instead sport exotic colorations
      ranging between green and purple. Formite hives tend to build complex subterranean
      nests, foraging from local plant and animal life. \r\n\r\nOnly Planet X\u2019s
      inhospitable arctics and swamps proved unsuitable terrain for the Formites
      to thrive. In point of fact, Fomite hives thrive in nearly any ecosystem and
      likely formed a significant portion of PlanetX\u2019s terrestrial animal biomass
      due to their minimum production rate of 10."

    text: "I think these little dudes are changing color? Or they\u2019re moving
      so fast that I\u2019m mixing them up with each other, which is pretty possible.
      There\u2019s not much here to take care of for them. They\u2019ve got some
      leaves, some dead bugs, and 5 water tiles in their terrarium. I bet they\u2019re
      eager to rebuild their nest\u2026 Bugs generally freak me out, but these are
      surprisingly pretty, especially the green ones."

      title: Observation Log Session #5
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "March 28, 3020, 8:00 am\r\nOriginally upon arriving on Planet X, we observed
      that there was an abundance of flora in proportion to visible fauna, and Dr.
      Star concluded that most species are herbivores. One notable exception appears
      to be Planet X\u2019s ant-like insectoids. Currently, they are transporting
      small pieces from a bird carcass. \r\n\r\nMarch 28, 3020, 11:00 am\r\nThe ant-like
      insectoids have returned to their nest. I tried to approach the nest in order
      to observe their behavior more closely, but they scurried inside the subterranean
      safety of their home, frustrating my attempts. The nest appears to align with
      terran patterns, except for a highly voluminous population. Taking samples
      now.\r"

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "Water Stress for Planet X Flora\r\n\r\nIn terran ants, recent studies
      have shown that widespread ant\u2013plant symbiosis increases with water stress.
      Given Natura Serva 22\u2019s focus on repopulation, minimal preliminary research
      of Planet X Formite hive-plant symbiosis has been conducted. Results thus far
      have revealed that Formica Collis requires 95% pure water composition. Terran
      trees invest more carbon in ants via phloem-feeding scale insects that provide
      ants with sugars, and the ants provide better defense of the carbon-producing
      leaves. Under water stress, the trees have smaller carbon pools. It is uncertain
      to what degree water limitation may increase the strength of a carbon-based
      mutualism in Planet X\u2019s plant life."
