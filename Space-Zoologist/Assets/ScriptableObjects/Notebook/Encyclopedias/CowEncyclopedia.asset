      title: Ecological Summary
      author: Eligans Impar
    text: "Dubbed Eligans Impar, this particular genus of bovinae-adjacent mammalians
      unique to Planet X, presents many similarities to domesticated terran cattle.
      These \u201Cstar cows\u201D have horns and cloven hooves much like their terran
      equivalents, as well as a solitary disposition that distinguishes them. They
      also have a similarly long reproductive period, which lasts over twice that
      of the Caprax Zeigrun \u2013 their closest cousins amongst Planet X\u2019s
      documented fauna\u2013 though populations under duress appear to decay at a
      pace similar to that of the Zeigrun.\r\n\r\nEligans Impar are omnivorous, and
      often successfully compete over food sources with not only the other various
      other smaller mammals native to Planet X, but also every other species yet
      encountered on Planet X. Their relationship to other species is not limited
      to simple displays of dominance, however, as the Eligans Impar also {prey upon
      the Humidum Limax}, a local species slug-like macrophages which other mammals
      largely ignore or avoid.\r\n\r\nHerds have been recorded in a wide variety
      of different biomes. While they appear to prefer grassland or loamy, barren
      dirt (which herds of Eligans Impar often create themselves via their vast caloric
      needs), herds have been observed {migrating through the craggy cliffs of the
      Pastillion Mountain Range, as well as the sandy environs surrounding the Caliga
      Basin}.There has been no recording sightings of an Eligans Impar herd in any
      of Planet X\u2019s numerous marshlands, nor do they appear to be particularly
      well adapted for aquatic living."

      title: Transport Log
      author: Barry Wachmann
    text: "You know, when Dr. Star said we were just going to be moving the local
      cow-equivalent, I thought it was going to be an easy gig. Boy, was that a mistake.\r\n\r\nAt
      first, they looked just like normal cows, so we treated them like it. As I
      started to feed them, though, {I quickly realized they\u2019re nothing like
      terran cows!} They didn\u2019t even sniff the nice little hay bale I put together
      for them! I\u2019ve never met a cow that would pass up on a nice, packed hay
      bale! It\u2019s even weirder, though, since Juno says the they do come from
      a grassland\u2026 Why do they live in a grassland if they don\u2019t like eating
      grass?!\r\n\r\n{Stubborn things only wanted what we were giving the Zeigs,
      and a lot of it! We only have about 4 of these babies in here, but they still
      blew through around forty Acernis Aurum fruits on the first day!} They must
      have multiple stomachs or something. {After that, we had to start giving them
      normal Acernis fruit and some Bacca berries. They ate just as much as them,
      but not happily!} \r\n\r\nNothing like what happened when Hutchins tried to
      give one a Glowcap and some Formica, though! The thing turned red, reared up,
      and revealed it had some claws hidden in its hoofs! Hutchins just about jumped
      out the airlock to get away!\r\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the
      space they take up! We barely have enough space for ourselves in the transport!
      Each cow needs at least 8 standard terrain tiles to itself, or it\u2019ll turn
      red and start attacking any and everything around it. I can\u2019t even understand
      how these things form herds!\r\n"

      title: Observation Log Session #12
      author: Juno
    text: "March 27, 3020, 1:00 pm\r\nA herd of approximately 20 Eligans Impar finally
      allowed me to approach within 10 feet without reading up and displaying their
      hoof-claws. \r\n\r\nIt was no easy task, and required 3 observation sessions
      and 5 different encounters with this specific herd, making them easily the
      most skittish species I\u2019ve encountered so far. Unusual. For a species
      with no natural predators to be so skittish presents something of an evolutionary
      enigma, especially since they seem to be well adapted for fighting off unknown
      threats thanks to their bulk and unusual hoof structures.\r\n\r\nIn any case,
      it was almost like meeting a pack of canines. The cows would often tilt their
      heads and sniff my extremities, as if unsure of just what kind of lifeform
      I was. They do not appear to have interacted with any other human(oid)s, nor
      any intelligent life that followed a similar evolutionary path.\r\n\r\nMarch
      27, 3020, 2:00 pm\r\nOnce the novelty of my presence wore off, the herd took
      me exactly where I was hoping to go: their watering hole. It was well-hidden
      inside a grove of Candentis Acernis, hence how it escaped our notice up until
      now, leading to speculation that this species had no need for water. An absurd
      speculation.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I noted the location and took some water samples.
      It seems the hole\u2019s salinity vacillated between around .5% and 2.5%, depending
      on where I took the samples. Furthermore, there was a portion of the pool which
      was exceptionally still and seemed to serve as the breeding ground for some
      small macrophages. It had an intense bacterial content \u2013 around 2%! \u2013
      and the herd completely avoided it. It seems safe to assume they would also
      avoid any water source which was more heavily infected, as well. \r\n"

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: 'Cow-moo-nication: Lack of Eligans Impar Vocalization



      Previous
      research shows that terran mothers and calves show individuality in vocalizations.
      As such, Natura Serva 22 has isolated five sets of mothers and calves in order
      to perform further research. We hypothesize that these Eligans Impar, much
      like terran cattle, will be able to distinguish between members of their herd
      and outsiders through subtle differences in vocalization unique to each herd.
      However, current acoustic analysis programs have not detected any vocalization
      from the groups being researched. Other enclosures have reported similar silence
      from their individual herds. Natura Serva 22 will begin integrating vocal cue
      studies in all Eligans Impar enclosures to observe the degree to which the
      cattle do or do not vocalize. The herds do appear to interact with each other
      and behave similarly to terran cows, which suggests an alternative method of
      communication.'
