      title: Ecological Summary - Eligans Impar
      author: 
    text: "Dubbed Eligans Impar, this particular genus of bovinae unique to Planet
      X, presents many similarities to terran cattle. These \u201Cstar cows\u201D
      have horns, cloven hooves, and prefer isolation from other species, much like
      their terran equivalents. {Star cows have a relatively high pure water requirement
      of 96%.}\r\n\r\nEligans Impar are omnivorous, and often compete over food sources
      with smaller Planet X mammals such as the CapraX Zeigrun. However, the Eligans
      Impar also seem to prey upon a local species slug-like macrophages which other
      mammals largely ignore or avoid. Herds have been recorded at Caloris Basin,
      Marineris Grasslands, and the outskirts of the Pastillion Mountain Range, {while
      unobserved in any swamp or water-based terrains.}"

    text: "I thought this gig was going to be easier, honestly. I\u2019m on the second
      group of cattle-type species from Planet X. Dr. Star has labeled them...Eligans
      Impar? I guess they\u2019re related to Impalas, or something? At first, they
      looked just like normal cows, so we treated them like it. As I started to feed
      them, though, {I quickly realized they\u2019re nothing like terran cows!} They
      didn\u2019t even sniff the nice little hay bale I put together for them! I\u2019ve
      never met a cow that would pass up on a nice, packed hay bale! {Stubborn things
      only wanted what we were giving the Zeigs, and a lot of it--about 9 per day.}
      They must have multiple stomachs or something."

      title: Observation Log Session #12
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: 'March 27, 3020, 1:00 pm

      A herd of approximately 20 Eligans Impar
      finally allowed me to approach within 10 feet. After 3 observation sessions
      and 5 different encounters with this specific herd, they seem to be more open.
      Almost like canines, the cows would often tilt their heads and sniff my extremities,
      as if unsure of just what kind of lifeform I was. They do not appear to have
      interacted with any other human(oid)s, nor any intelligent life that followed
      a similar evolutionary path.'

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: 'Cow-moo-nication: Lack of Eligans Impar Vocalization



      Previous
      research shows that terran mothers and calves show individuality in vocalizations.
      As such, Natura Serva 22 has isolated five sets of mothers and calves in order
      to perform further research. We hypothesize that these Eligans Impar, much
      like terran cattle, will be able to distinguish between members of their herd
      and outsiders through subtle differences in vocalization unique to each herd.
      However, current acoustic analysis programs have not detected any vocalization
      from the groups being researched. Other enclosures have reported similar silence
      from their individual herds. Natura Serva 22 will begin integrating vocal cue
      studies in all Eligans Impar enclosures to observe the degree to which the
      cattle do or do not vocalize. The herds do appear to interact with each other
      and behave similarly to terran cows, which suggests an alternative method of
      communication.'
