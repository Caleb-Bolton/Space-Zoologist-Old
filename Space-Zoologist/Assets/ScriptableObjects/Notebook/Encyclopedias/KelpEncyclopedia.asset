      title: Ecological Summary - Coruscent Laminar
      author: 
    text: Coruscent Laminar, commonly referred to as Flanweed, is a bright green
      heterokont consisting of flat, leaf-like structures known as blades. Kelp forests
      typically support a large number of animals. Larger invertebrates are secondary
      consumers of kelp, although they are rarely found inside dense kelp forests.
      Paradoxically, Flanweed appears to ignore salt water while having a high pure
      water and bacteria requirement, necessitating a mix of fresh and stagnant water.

    text: "Testing kelp as a viable food source for the Zeigs did not go well. The
      Stroteaters also didn\u2019t want to touch it. Actual strots probably don\u2019t
      like it either, so I imagine only aquatic creatures, like slugs and sharks,
      would enjoy eating Planet X\u2019s Flandweed--and mayyyyybe humans? This is
      an endangered plant, so I really shouldn\u2019t test that hypothesis out. They
      don\u2019t seem hard to get to grow, though..."

      title: Observation Log Session #3
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "March 29, 3020, 8:00 am\r\nThe underwater probe has detected little to
      no invertebrates attached to the outskirts of the kelp forest. Their presence
      may be deterred due to the large group of sea otters near this particular patch.
      Moving locations shortly.\r\n\r\nMarch 29, 3020, 11:00 am\r\nProbe is currently
      10,000 ft below sea level. A larger abundance of bristle worms, scud, prawns,
      and snails are traveling through the kelp forests. Imaging indicates an atypical
      hue to the creatures. Current water composition: pure water, 97%; salt content,
      1%; bacteria content, 4%.\r"

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Aurora Star
    text: "Coruscent Laminar Carbon-Capture Efficiency\r\n\r\nFound in both fresh
      and saltwater, terran kelp has one of the highest carbon dioxide capture efficiencies,
      ranging from 80% to 99% observed. Planet X\u2019s unique lack of noticeable
      intelligent life suggests a low carbon dioxide emission rate. The resting surface
      temperature, on average across continents, was reported to be 16.2 C, higher
      than the current terran average. It is currently unknown what may account for
      a higher temperature despite a lack of human-produced emissions. One possibility
      lies within the flora of Planet X. This study will investigate Planet X\u2019s
      prominent kelp species, Coruscent Laminar, and its ability (or proposed lack
      thereof) to capture carbon."
