      title: Ecological Summary - Coruscent Laminar
      author: 
    text: "Coruscent Laminar, or Planet X\u2019s equivalent of terran kelp, has been
      observed to grow in underwater forests. Coruscent Laminar is a bright green
      heterokont consisting of flat, leaf-like structures known as blades. Kelp forests
      typically support a large number of animals and larger invertebrates are secondary
      consumers of kelp, although they are rarely found inside dense kelp forests."

    text: "Testing kelp as a viable food source for the zeigs did not go well. The
      anteaters also didn\u2019t want to touch it, but the ants scavenged it up.
      I imagine only aquatic creatures would enjoy eating Planet X\u2019s kelp--and
      perhaps humans? This is an endangered plant, so I really shouldn\u2019t test
      that hypothesis out. They don\u2019t seem hard to get to grow, though..."

      title: Observation Log Session #3
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "<b>March 29, 3020, 8:00 am\r</b>\nThe underwater probe has detected little
      to no invertebrates attached to the outskirts of the kelp forest. Their presence
      may be deterred due to the large group of sea otters near this particular patch.
      Moving locations shortly.\r\n\r\n<b>March 29, 3020, 11:00 am\r</b>\nProbe is
      currently 10,000 ft below sea level. A larger abundance of bristle worms, scud,
      prawns, and snails are traveling through the kelp forests. Imaging indicates
      an atypical hue to the creatures.\r"

      title: Research Abstract - Under Review
      author: Aurora Star
    text: "<b>Coruscent Laminar Carbon-Capture Efficiency\r</b>\n\r\nFound in both
      fresh and saltwater, terran kelp has one of the highest carbon dioxide capture
      efficiencies, ranging from 80% to 99% observed. Planet X\u2019s unique lack
      of noticeable intelligent life suggests a low carbon dioxide emission rate.
      The resting surface temperature, on average across continents, was reported
      to be 16.2 C, higher than the current terran average. It is currently unknown
      what may account for a higher temperature despite a lack of human-produced
      emissions. One possibility lies within the flora of Planet X. This study will
      investigate Planet X\u2019s prominent kelp species, Coruscent Laminar, and
      its ability (or proposed lack thereof) to capture carbon.\r"
