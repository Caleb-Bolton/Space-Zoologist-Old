    text: "February 20, 3020\r\nWe have achieved first contact with Planet X. No
      immediate surrounding threats or signs of intelligent life are present.\r\n\r\nFebruary
      21, 3020\r\nPlanet X is uninhabited by humanoids. However, given the evolution
      of Homosapiens, I am unsure if there is a possibility for intelligent life
      to evolve.\r\n\r\nFebruary 22, 3020\r\nJuno has found something interesting.
      It seems something stepped on some of her papers when she was away and it left
      some footprints that we don't yet have recorded. What species made these?\n\r\nMarch
      20, 3020\r\nThere is still no sign of living lifeforms matching the unidentified
      lifeform's footprints. How did it manage to leave footprints and get away so
      fast?\n\r\nMarch 23, 3020\r\nWe do not have much time until Planet X is fully
      drawn into the decaying black hole. I fear we will never discover the full
      extent of life on this planet, before it\u2019s too late to save them.\r\n\r\nApril
      3, 3020\r\nThe rescue teams believe they have saved at least a couple of every
      species present on Planet X, still no signs of a species even remotely close
      to the footprints Juno showed me.\r\n\r\nApril 10, 3020\r\nPlanet X is very
      close to complete annihilation by the black hole, rescue teams are making their
      last sweeps of the planet to see if they\u2019ve missed anything.\r\n\r\nApril
      11, 3020\r\nRescue teams have conveyed to me that they seem to have found one
      species they haven't collected yet. They are doing their best to try and capture
      at least one specimen but they are too quick and frightened, often getting
      away before they get a chance to catch them.\r\n\r\nApril 13, 3020\r\nIt is
      estimated that the 14th will be the last possible day for us to be present
      on planet X. I am going with the rescue team today in an effort to catch this
      final species. We currently have eyes on a specimen.\r\n\r\nApril 14, 3020\r\nAfter
      chasing the mysterious species, it seems to have gotten away. The rescue team
      is starting to pack up since today is the final day we can safely be on Planet
      X and we are getting dangerously close to the black hole. This means we weren\u2019t
      able to preserve every species from Planet X. I\u2019m sorry whatever you were,
      we didn\u2019t even get a chance to name you... Mimi, that\u2019s a good name
      for it... Goodbye Mimi. \r\n"

      title: Transport Log
      author: Barry Wachmann
    text: "\u2013Initial Logs \u2013 \r\n\r\nBeen cleanin' the Flan out of one of
      our transports, and whadd'ya know but I found some strange buggers in the back
      of the transport. Seems to be a new species that I can't find any record of
      in our mainframe. The little guys seemed absolutely parched, so I got 'em some
      water right away. Took a bit of fiddlin' to find the right mixture, but they
      ended up satisfied with anything at least 96% pure, with anywhere from .5 to
      2.5% salinity. They do not seem to like bacteria in their water, and instantly
      spat anything with more than 1.5% bacteria back out \u2013 all over me, when
      possible. \r\n\r\nOnce I got the water sorted, I did some work tryin' to find
      food that they'd take to, but it was a bit of a struggle. They didn't seem
      interested in any of the fruit I put in front of them. I figured they might
      prefer foliage to fruits, so I took them to our nursery, where they started
      perchin in Astral Maple trees and Bacca Bushes. It seems these are important
      pieces of terrain in their home ecosystem. I never spied them eating anythin',
      but they're slippery little buggers, so I suspect they simply were eating outside
      of where I could see them\u2026\r\n\r\nI ended up puttin' them in pens between
      all of the other species with a good assortment of the Astral Maples and Bacca
      Bushes placed inside. I started them off in pens all to themselves, but they
      wouldn't sit still there, and kept breakin' out and into the pens of the other
      species. They seem tame enough now that they're surrounded by the others, but
      still only live on the edges of the pen, and ignore the middle entirely. Almost
      like their social with the other animals or somethin', they don't seem to be
      communicatin' with them, though, so that can't be it\u2026\r\n\r\nThey sure
      are social little buggers, though. They darn near dogpile me anytime I enter
      the pen, and engage in what I can only assume is some kind of social grooming
      behavior. Hope they don't poke my eyes out or anythin'...\r\n\r\n\u2013 Updated
      Notes Post-Rediscovery \u2013\r\n\r\nHow could I have been so blind?! The Mimis
      ain't engagin' in social activities with the other species, they're groomin'
      them! A microscopic analysis makes it clear that that the Mimis aren't just
      cleanin' them of dust or other particulates, either. Instead, they're eating
      a huge variety of tiny, insectoid parasites off the other species. These creatures
      ain't attached to any Mimi I can find, but every other species on Planet X
      has their own menu of unique, fast-growing parasites, and most specimens are
      absolutely covered in rows of 'em! The Mimis make sure never to pick 'em all
      off, either. If I had to guess, it actually looks like some kind of primitive
      cultivation, since the Mimis make sure the parasites are plentiful enough to
      keep reproducin', thereby ensuring their food supply isn't wiped out. Regardless
      it seems they need every species from Planet X around in order to survive!\r\n\r\nThe
      Astral Maples and Bacca Bushes are still an important part of the equation,
      though, as the Mimis prefer to perch in them, and don't seem to have any other
      terrain needs. They like swoopin' down from the Astal Maples onto anything
      that passes through, which they'll compulsively groom once they land. Guess
      that's why I ain't had to keep usin' the dandruff shampoo, and why my skin
      is doin' better than ever, huh?\r\n\r\nJuno ended up renamin' the Mimis to
      Lemuroidea Empathicus, which we think is a good fit. There's no sign the Mimis
      have cross-species empathy the way sentient species sometimes do, but they
      seem to be slightly sensitive to moods in much the way a dog might be. They
      do exhibit a wide range of emotions amongst their own kind, though, and are
      extremely social. They have a wide vocal range, which they seem to use to communicate
      amongst their own kind. Probably why Juno heard them immediately, huh.\r\n\r\n\u2013
      Additional Notes - Juno \u2013\r\n\r\nNo. Kidding.\r"
