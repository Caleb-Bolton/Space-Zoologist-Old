    text: "February 20, 3020\r\nWe have achieved first contact with Planet X. No
      immediate surrounding threats or signs of intelligent life are present.\r\n\r\nFebruary
      21, 3020\r\nPlanet X is uninhabited by humanoids. However, given the evolution
      of Homosapiens, I am unsure if there is a possibility for intelligent life
      to evolve.\r\n\r\nFebruary 22, 3020\r\nJuno has located a strange fossil. She
      brought it to me immediately, of course. Its structure reminds me of Pan Troglodytes\u2026\r\n\r\nMarch
      20, 3020\r\nThere is still no sign of living lifeforms matching the unidentified
      lifeform\u2019s remains. Other species similarly appear to be in decline, although
      not extinct. What happened here?\r\n\r\nMarch 23, 3020\r\nWe do not have much
      time until Planet X is fully drawn into the decaying black hole. I fear we
      will never discover the full extent of life on this planet, before it\u2019s
      too late to save them.\r\n\r\nApril 3, 3020\r\nThe rescue teams believe they
      have saved at least a couple of every species present on Planet X, still no
      signs of a species even remotely close to the fossil Juno showed me.\r\n\r\nApril
      10, 3020\r\nPlanet X is very close to complete annihilation by the black hole,
      rescue teams are making their last sweeps of the planet to see if they\u2019ve
      missed anything.\r\n\r\nApril 11, 3020\r\nRescue teams have conveyed to me
      that they seem to have found one species they haven't collected yet. They are
      doing their best to try and capture at least one specimen but they are too
      quick and frightened, often getting away before they get a chance to catch
      them.\r\n\r\nApril 13, 3020\r\nIt is estimated that the 14th will be the last
      possible day for us to be present on planet X. I am going with the rescue team
      today in an effort to catch this final species. We currently have eyes on a
      specimen.\r\n\r\nApril 14, 3020\r\nAfter chasing the mysterious species, it
      seems to have gotten away. The rescue team is starting to pack up since today
      is the final day we can safely be on Planet X and we are getting dangerously
      close to the black hole. This means we weren\u2019t able to preserve every
      species from Planet X. I\u2019m sorry whatever you were, we didn\u2019t even
      get a chance to name you... Mimi, that\u2019s a good name for it... Goodbye
      Mimi. \r\n"

    text: "After clearing out the Flan from one of their stasis chambers, I discovered
      something strange in the back of one of their chambers. It seems to be a new
      species that we don\u2019t have recorded? It seemed very famished so I gave
      it some water. After some experimentation it seemed to be satisfied with water
      that was at least 96% pure with 0.5% to 2.5% salinity and at most 1.5% bacteria
      content. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve attempted giving it all sorts of different food
      sources common to the other species from Planet X, but it doesn\u2019t seem
      interested in any of them. Woah! It\u2019s flying away! I didn\u2019t even
      realize it had wings! It\u2019s going towards one of the Flan from earlier!
      This is bad, it might be a predator to them! Oh, wait... it seems to be picking
      mites and other things from the Flan\u2019s body? The Flan seems to be enjoying
      it actually. Hold on.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this mysterious species has a symbiotic
      relationship with Flan? They seem to be cleaning different sorts of bugs and
      whatnot its mucus. Perhaps it will have a similar relationship with other animals?
      It also seems that picking and eating these mites might be it\u2019s main source
      of calorie intake? This will need further testing. \r\n\r\nAfter doing further
      research, it seems this new species prefers to sit in trees and other flora
      such as Astral Maple trees and Bacca berry bushes. It seems that these plants
      satisfy its terrain needs rather than usual terrain. It also seems to require
      many different other species nearby rather than just one in order to thrive.
      In fact, the new species seems to need one of every other species discovered
      on Planet X nearby in order to thrive. This animal is truly unlike any other
      we\u2019ve seen from Planet X. Maybe this could be my chance to redeem myself
      after what happened with that other species...\r\n\r\nI think the name Lemuroidea
      Empathicus will fit this creature well, but I\u2019ll call it Mimi for short,
      based on Dr. Star\u2019s notes.\r\n"
