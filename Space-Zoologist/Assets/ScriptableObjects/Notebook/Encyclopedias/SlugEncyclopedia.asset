      title: Ecological Summary
      author: Humidum Limax (Flan)
    text: "Humidum Limax are a tough-skinned mollusk composed of one large stomach
      muscle which propels their movement. Flan, their common name, have aligned
      with terran environmental expectations, but their current eating patterns are
      varied. Humidum Limax are also nocturnal and sensitive to ambient temperature.
      Birds do not appear to be the Flan\u2019s predator, so its current predation
      relationships are undetermined. \r\n\r\nFlan have a low consumption rate of
      2-3 per day, thus allowing for seclusive tendencies and self-preservation from
      potentially dangerous predators. They tend to mostly consume the kelp-like
      Coruscent Laminar (Flanweed), though they have also been observed consuming
      Boletus Anceps (Glowcap), when given the opportunity."

    text: "Dr. Star was telling me to be more professional with my note keeping\u2026
      here goes. \r\n\r\nApril 8, 3020 1:13 am\r\nThese are slugs, because snails
      have shells, and these do not have shells. Most of both species live near,
      if not in, water and can survive on land. But also, this is space, so they\u2019re
      maybe not slugs at all. They remind me of flan, the dessert. \r\n\r\nApril
      8, 3020 3:44 pm\r\nThey seem content in the water tank aboard ship. Water tank
      values have been rotated every hour. Currently, a minimum of 95.5% pure water
      composition is required. Maximum salt content is 1.5%.\r\n\r\nApril 8, 3020
      5:02 pm\r\nAfter transferring five Flan into a mix of dirt-water terrain to
      test survival, I observed that the Flan were more content in swamp-like depths
      than their original water tank. Further testing required.\r"

      title: Observation Log Session #39
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "March 27, 3020, 4:00 am\r\nTerran slugs typically eat any and all available
      food sources in their travel path. However, these Flan slugs appear to be targeting
      Strots present at the surface of Carigoln Lake.\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 3020, 10:00
      am\r\nChanged location to Broree Lake. Less Flan than at Carigoln Lake are
      eating Strots, in favor of the lake\u2019s abundant Flanweed sources. \r\n\r\nMarch
      27, 3020, 2:00 pm\r\nChanged location to the Pastillion Mountain Range. I have
      spotted a solitary Flan, the only one present in the range. Its secretion trail
      leads to a nearby water source.\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 3020 2:45 pm\r\nUpon my return
      to the Flan, from a distance, a herd of Eligans Impar (Lumoo) began grazing.
      The Flan began crawling at an increased pace, only to be eaten by one of the
      herd.\r"

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "Planet X Gastropod Diversity: Extinct or Non-Existent Snails?\r\n\r\nIn
      terran mollusks, snails are averse to slug secretions, causing some difficulties
      with cohabitation. Despite a thorough surface search of Planet X, even in water
      biomes without the presence of slugs, no snails were observed. Due to the planet\u2019s
      destruction, evidence indicating other gastropod groups may only be found through
      researching existing preserved species. Thus far, Humidum Limax have exhibited
      extreme aversion to fruits, instead preferring the water-based Coruscent Laminar
      (Flanweed) and Boletus Anceps (Glowcap), which is another deviation from terran
      gastropods. It is hypothesized that snails were simply non-existent on Planet
      X."
