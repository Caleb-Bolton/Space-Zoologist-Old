      title: Ecological Summary - CapraX Zeigrun
      author: 
    text: "{The first rescue teams deployed to Planet X quickly encountered CapraX
      Zeigrun, a terran Capra Aegagrus Hircus-adjacent species}, in the middle and
      lower regions of the Pastillion Mountain Range. The terrain in the rescue area
      was noted to be a combination of dirt and grass, with occasional rock, similar
      to the terran chaparral biome. The middle and lower parts of the Pastillion
      Mountain Range supported few plant species, {the most common being the astral
      maple, Candentis Acernis.} \r\n\r\nIsometric drawing (below) for {the Zeig
      enclosure requires 2,500 sq. ft. of space. 500 sq. ft. of said enclosure must
      be reserved for mimicking a freshwater lake} much like the one seen in the
      Pastillion Mountain Range."

    text: "These goats are the cutest thing I have ever seen! I mean, come on, they\u2019re
      freaking blue! I can\u2019t help but wonder what makes a goat blue, though...
      I wish I could have seen Planet X when it was still around. Wonder what else
      was on there\u2026 \r\n\r\nAnyways, yeah, transport log notes! \r\n\r\nAt 11:23:60,
      we ran out of Acernis fruit. The rest is under strict cryofreeze or something.
      Way above my pay grade, or so Juno says. So, instead, they gave us {some berries
      they found on-planet. The goats seem to like them alright, but they don\u2019t
      gobble them up anywhere near as quick as the Gilded Astral Maple fruit!}\r\n\r\n{I
      tried to give them a mushroom, but the face it made was unhappy,} to say the
      least, and it just about bit my hand off in anger. Similarly, they\u2019re
      a little picky about the water, which {needs to be about 96% pure water. They
      seem to want a little salt, but not more than 2%.}\r\n\r\nWeirdest thing is,
      though, that these things barely eat! {Most only eat, at most, one fruit every
      four hours.} Man, my partner would be thrilled if Homeosapiens didn\u2019t
      have to eat so much and spend so much money on food\u2026 could their metabolism
      be a possible solution to food waste?"

      title: Observation Log Session #46
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "June 6th, 3020, 6:00 am\r\nLocated at the bottom of the eastern edge of
      the Pastillion Mountain Range, in observation site A. Observation session #46
      goals: 1) account for the various population sizes migrating and 2) update
      the liquid requirements database. Observation schedule is set to every 30 minutes,
      and will reduce to every 10 minutes when a population has been spotted. \r\n\r\nJune
      6th, 3020, 6:30 am\r\nNo signs of goat migration, but the planet\u2019s sunrise
      created flashes of color on the filled basin as it rose behind me.\r\n\r\nJune
      6th, 3020, 7:05 am\r\nI observed the first goat population emerge from the
      now vibrant maple. Total of 12 goats were sighted. Observation session #46
      aligns with previous log data. {10-14 goats appear to be standard population
      size. 4-10 astral maple per herd.\r}\n\r\nJune 6th, 3020, 7:15 am\r\nA total
      of 3 different populations are currently spread around the perimeter of the
      lake. \r\n\r\nOn the far left is the most recent population observed, {with
      6 goats total.} The herd moved at a comparatively sluggish pace. They originated
      from the south eastern edge of the Pastillion Basin, {noted for its distinct
      lack of dirt.} \n\r\nTowards the middle of the Basin is a population featuring
      {12 goats consuming the lake\u2019s liquid and maple fruit. They appear not
      only the largest herd, but perhaps the most well-fed.\r}\n\r\nThe population
      furthest from me features {8 goats, still below the estimated average population.}
      There are {very few local maples in their grazing area,} but they appear to
      instead be eating some sort of berries."

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "Population Status, Threats, and Conservation of the CapraX Zeigrun\r\n\r\nCapraX
      Zeigrun previously resided in the Pastillion Mountain Range on the now-obliterated
      Planet X. The planet\u2019s destruction has led to ex-situ, or off-site, conservation,
      instead of originally planned in-situ, or on-site, restoration. Four space
      goats are currently in rehabilitation in the international nature preservation,
      Natura Serva 22, under care of a team of Planet X researchers. {Its original
      habitat was composed of a combination of grasslands, dirt-based terrain, and
      rocky, mountainous terrain. Herds of approximately 10-14 individuals regularly
      migrated in an anomalous pattern around the basin\u2019s central freshwater
      lake, which seemed to be an integral part of the species\u2019 lifestyle. Herds
      tended to move such that approximately 6-10 Candentis Avernis, or \u201Castral
      maple\u201D trees, were within easy feeding range at any particular time. Current
      conservation measures are attempting to approximate and reconstruct a habitat
      enclosure similar to the Pastillion Mountain Range using flora and fauna from
      species samples rescued from Planet X before its destruction."
