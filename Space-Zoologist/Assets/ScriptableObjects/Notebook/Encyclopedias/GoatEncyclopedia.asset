      title: Ecological Summary
      author: CapraX Zeigrun
    text: "{The first rescue teams deployed to Planet X quickly encountered CapraX
      Zeigrun, a terran Capra Aegagrus Hircus-adjacent species}, in the middle and
      lower regions of the Pastillion Mountain Range. {The terrain in the rescue
      area was noted to be a combination of dirt and grass, with occasional rock,}
      similar to the terran chaparral biome. {In particular, the Zeigs seem to really
      love grass as they can often be seen herded together around patches of it.}
      The middle and lower parts of the Pastillion Mountain Range supported few plant
      species \u2013 {the most common of which was the ubiquitous astral maple, Candentis
      Acernis \u2013  and isolated the Caprax Zeigrun from most other species.} \r\n\r\nIsometric
      drawing (below) for the Zeig enclosure requires 2,500 sq. ft. (100 tiles) of
      space. 500 sq. ft. (20 tiles) of said enclosure must be reserved for mimicking
      a macrophage-free freshwater lake much like the one seen in the Pastillion
      Mountain Range. {For a single Zeig however, they only need 4 tiles of terrain
      and 2 tiles of water.} \n\nThe Caprax Zeigrun seem to have lost the ability
      to process water that differs greatly from their lake in the Pastillion Mountain
      Range, and thus have somewhat limited water tolerances. They will avoid all
      water sources with more than 2% salinity and don't seem to mind bactrial populations
      much, but need a level of atleast 96% pure water.\n\r\nEarly analysis indicates
      that Caprax Zeigrun, much like the terran goats they are often mistaken for,
      have a very limited set of terrain preferences which they will not deviate
      from. Attempts to relocate individuals onto sandy terrain or into marshland
      have all resulted in agitation, illness, and even death of the relocated specimens.\r"

    text: "These zeigs are the cutest thing I have ever seen! I mean, come on, they\u2019re
      freaking blue! I can\u2019t help but wonder what makes a goat blue, though...
      I wish I could have seen Planet X when it was still around. Wonder what else
      was on there\u2026 Maybe they got blue by rolling around in blue grass! Wouldn\u2019t
      that be a sight to see\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyways, yeah, transport log notes! \r\n\r\nAt
      11:23:60, we ran out of Acernis fruit. The rest is under strict cryofreeze
      or something. Juno says the details are strictly on a need to know basis, and
      habitat wreckers don\u2019t need to know. Could have been a bit nicer about
      it\u2026\r\n\r\nSo, anyways, they gave us {some berries they found on-planet
      instead. The goats seem to like them alright, but they don\u2019t gobble them
      up anywhere near as quick as Acernis Aurum fruit!} \r\n\r\n{I tried to give
      one of them a glowcap, but it just snarled at me and almost bit my arm off!}
      Same thing happened to Hutchins when she tried to give another one some of
      the Formicas that the Strots like. They\u2019re also super picky about water.
      Don\u2019t try to feed one water that\u2019s not about 96% pure. They\u2019ll
      just spit it right back in your face. Bleh. \r\n\r\n{That said, they seem to
      be okay with a little salt, but not more than 2%, and they\u2019ll spit up
      water that\u2019s too pure too, so watch out!.}\r\n\r\nWeirdest thing is, though,
      that these things barely eat and don\u2019t need as much space to themselves
      as you\u2019d think! They may look like goats, but they don\u2019t have the
      appetite, and they\u2019re definitely much less ornery! {Space-wise they all
      seem to need only about four standard terrain tiles to themselves apiece, so
      our transport vessel was way bigger than needed, at least for these guys. Most
      only eat, at most, six fruits every day, and sometimes not even that!} \r\n\r\nMan,
      Larry would be thrilled if he only had to eat a few acernis fruits every day\u2026Would
      fix our budget right up!\r"

      title: Observation Log
      author: Juno
    text: "June 6th, 3020, 6:00 am\r\nLocation: Pastillion Mountain Range. Foothills.
      Eastern End.\r\nTerrain Composition: Barren crags, interspersed with patches
      of soil where the angle permits. This soil is broken up by infrequent but large
      patches of a crabgrass analog. Ideal terrain for the Caprax Zeigrun.\r\nObservational
      goals: See how specimens react to the arrival of foreign, invasive species
      in their habitat. To this end I have transported a number of Planet X\u2019s
      other fauna to the nearby lake, to view how the local Caprax Zeigrun population
      reacts to each. This research is considered vital in order to establish any
      possible predator-prey relationships which may develop amongst specimens sharing
      enclosures in the future.\r\n\r\nJune 6th, 3020, 6:30 am\r\nNo signs of the
      local Caprax Zeigrun population yet. The sun has just risen, tainted purple
      as it is by Planet X\u2019s unusual atmosphere and the presence of the local
      rogue singularity. The splashes of alien color across the still lake provided
      a sight which I shall not soon forget. I shall miss this place, once it\u2019s
      gone.\r\n\r\nJune 6th, 3020, 7:05 am\r\nThe local Caprax Zeigrun population
      has just entered the lake valley and encountered the first invasive species
      \u2013 a small herd of Eligans Impar that I planted near the local Candentis
      Acernis grove. After a brief period of confusion, it became clear that {neither
      species was going to prey on the other}. However, the Eligans Impars superior
      size ensured that they were able to feed first, while the Caprax Zeigrun were
      forced to merely watch and dine on the low-hanging fruits that remained once
      the Impars had their fill.\r\n\r\nJune 6th, 3020, 7:45 am\r\nOnce the Caprax
      Zeigrun herd finished eating, they continued further into the basin, towards
      the lakeside. There they encountered the small group of Thalassius Succo that
      I planted near the lakeshore. While the Caprax Zeigrun demonstrated some initial
      concerns about the presence of an alien species, the two quickly began ignoring
      each other, unless they were competing for food or water. When the two came
      into conflict over resources, it was always the Caprax Zeigrun who triumphed.\r\n\r\nJune
      6th, 3020, 12:00 pm\r\nOver the course of the day, the Caprax Zeigrun have
      now interacted with each other Planet X species we\u2019ve earmarked for resettlement.
      In all cases the behavior was no different than the ones highlighted above,
      hence a lack of more detailed notes.{There were no predator-prey relationships
      observed, and the Caprax Zeigrun continued to dominate the species smaller
      than them \u2013 such as the Humidum Limax and Thalassius Succo \u2013 while
      yielding too species who were larger or more aggressive than them \u2013 such
      as the Ligurio Vermis and Eligans Impar.}\r"

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "Population Status, Threats, and Conservation of the CapraX Zeigrun\r\n\r\nCapraX
      Zeigrun previously resided in the Pastillion Mountain Range on the now-obliterated
      Planet X. The planet\u2019s destruction has led to ex-situ, or off-site, conservation,
      instead of originally planned in-situ, or on-site, restoration. Four space
      goats are currently in rehabilitation in the international nature preservation,
      Natura Serva 22, under care of a team of Planet X researchers. {Its original
      habitat was composed of a combination of grasslands, dirt-based terrain, and
      rocky, mountainous terrain. Herds of approximately 10-14 individuals regularly
      migrated in an anomalous pattern around the basin\u2019s central freshwater
      lake, which seemed to be an integral part of the species\u2019 lifestyle. Herds
      tended to move such that approximately 6-10 Candentis Avernis, or \u201Castral
      maple\u201D trees, were within easy feeding range at any particular time.}
      Current conservation measures are attempting to approximate and reconstruct
      a habitat enclosure similar to the Pastillion Mountain Range using flora and
      fauna from species samples rescued from Planet X before its destruction. "
