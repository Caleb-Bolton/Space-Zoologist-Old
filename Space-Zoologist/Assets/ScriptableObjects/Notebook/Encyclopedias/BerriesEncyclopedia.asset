      title: Ecological Summary - Vaccinum Spatium Bacca
      author: 
    text: "Vaccinum Spatium Bacca is a colorful highbush typically found in clusters,
      {which regularly produces 7-10 berries daily.} These spaceberries, as they\u2019re
      frequently called, have been observed as compatible food for a wide variety
      of Planet X species. \r\n\r\nInformally termed Bacca Bushes, this species is
      a deciduous fruiting shrub, thus far primarily found in heathlands and biomes
      featuring acidic soil. {As a shallow-rooted plant, Bacca Bushes rarely grow
      in close proximity to flora with deeper roots, such as the astral maple and
      its subspecies.}"

    text: "April 8, 3020, 11:58 am\r\nAll looks in order. 40 spaceberry bushes in
      containment pods. {Acquired 7 units of nearby fresh water for sustenance, although
      a lower pure water percentage is acceptable.} Picking 2 bushes as feed for
      the trip.\r\n\r\nApril 8, 3020, 4:28 pm\r\nNo change since morning observation. 
      Average production rate appears to be between 7-10 thus far.\r"

      title: Observation Log Berry Bush Session #3
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "April 1, 3020, 6:01 am\r\nThis is the last observation log I\u2019m going
      to write for this specific plant. These plants really aren\u2019t that different
      from the typical terran blackberry bush. The only notable divergence thus far
      is that the fruits are much more...spicy. Whether this is meant to lure the
      local fauna into eating them or is some futile evolutionary defense meant to
      discourage them from doing so is, as of yet, unknown.\r"

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "Similar Evolutionary Processes for Genus Vaccinium Across Planets\r\n\r\nVaccinum
      Spatium Bacca are a species that produces fruit year-round. Comparable to the
      Terran genus vaccinium, the Vaccinum Spatium Bacca bush is a deciduous fruiting
      shrub found in heathlands and anywhere else with acidic topsoil. {Bacca Bushes
      have not been found in any rocky or sand-based terrain, as expected of a shallow-rooted
      plant.} However, Bacca Bushes\u2019 unnaturally high production rate is not
      the only factor that distinguishes this plant from terran berry bushes. Natura
      Serva 22 ecologists are currently researching varying flavors produced by Vaccinum
      Spatium Bacca, including \u201Cspicy,\u201D \u201Cumami,\u201D \u201Csweet,\u201D
      and \u201Ccitrusy.\u201D It is unclear what impacts the flavor and color produced
      by the separate clusters."
