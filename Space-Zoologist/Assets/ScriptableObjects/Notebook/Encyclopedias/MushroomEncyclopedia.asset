      title: Ecological Summary - Boletus Anceps
      author: 
    text: Boletus Anceps, commonly dubbed Glowcaps, is a spore-bearing fruiting body
      of a fungus. The most common variant of Glowcaps is a gilled fungi with stems.
      Observed to be a rapidly growing species, the developing primordium from which
      Boletus Anceps develops is unusually large, at around 4 millimeters in diameter.
      {Similarly, production rates for nearby predators appear to be 5-8 edible caps
      and extensions.}

      author: Barry Wachmann
    text: "Soft and squishy like a fishy! Boletus Anceps appears to absorb water
      very well, particularly allowing for more salt and bacteria than other flora
      I\u2019ve transported. Bacteria is usually akin to poison for most flora and
      fauna from Planet X, but this species seems comfortable with a diverse composition.
      Similarly, their pure water need only appears to be around 94%. Strange, for
      a species not found in salt water."

      (I get to observe, yay!) The transplantation
      of Boletus Anceps from the Pastillion Mountain Range into other notable biomes
      is complete. I hope they grow!

      {A week
      later, the hyphae networks, or mycelium, have rapidly grown in swamp, dirt,
      and grass biomes.} They must have a preference for terrain with soil and relative
      ease of access to water. No indication of hyphae strands are present in deserts
      thus far.'

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "Liquid Composition Needs in Planet X\u2019s Popular Flora\r\n\r\nBoletus
      Anceps was observed to require a minimum of 94% pure water and 2% bacteria,
      with an unusually large root radius of 6 by interning researcher Barry Wachmann
      at Natura Serva 22. The most similar popular flora, Coruscent Laminar, has
      a similar bacteria need; however, its root radius and pure water needs are
      almost opposite, sitting at around 1 and 97% respectively. While both species
      rely on water for survival, Boletus Anceps only finding thriving terrain in
      swamps and Coruscent Laminar only present in water pools, the degree of variance
      requires further investigation."
