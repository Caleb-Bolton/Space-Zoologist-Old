      title: Ecological Summary - Thalassius Succo
      author: 
    text: Thalassius Succo range from 0.02 to 3.5 inches in length, featuring two
      main body parts, four legs, two non-venomous, pincer-like appendages, and six
      pairs of spinnerets. Thalassius Succo were observed to scale rocky mountain
      terrain using intricate webs. The animal and its extruded silk vary between
      blues and greens. Thalassius Succo was observed to survive in three different
      terrain types, despite an increase of predators in grasslands.

    text: "Dr. Star instructed me to test out Thalassius Succo\u2019s food preferences.
      I started with what seems to be the most common food accepted by Planet X animals--berries.
      The Succo suckers just rolled the berries around for fun instead of eating
      them, though. They seemed to like eating insects and various types of mushrooms.
      They\u2019re pretty small, so they didn\u2019t consume much of my stock, maybe
      3-5 bits of food per animal."

    text: "March 29, 3020, 9:00 am\r\nThalassius Succo appears to be spending equal
      time in Carigoln Lake proper and its surrounding terrain. As a freshwater lake,
      this species\u2019 survivability most likely decreases in salt water\u2026
      \r\n\r\nMarch 29, 3020, 12:00 pm\r\nIncoming report of Thalassius Succo sighted
      in the Atacail Desert. Odd. Given the species\u2019 previous adherence to rock
      and grass-based terrain, this is highly unusual. Repositioning now."

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "Predator-Prey Interactions: Thalassius Succo vs. Terran Terrestrial Insects\r\n\nTerran
      spiders are well known for their predator-prey relationships, particularly
      their tendency to only eat living organisms. Rare species prey upon veretebrates
      such as frogs, lizards, and bats, while most terran spiders consume insects
      and other spiders. Planet X\u2019s Thalassius Succo, the predominant spider-like
      species, has not been observed as a predator to any other species, or its fellows.
      Due to its natural proximity to water, however, Thalassius Succo appears to
      be prey to Humidum Limax. Further predator-prey relationships necessitate further
      study and experimentation with differing species."
