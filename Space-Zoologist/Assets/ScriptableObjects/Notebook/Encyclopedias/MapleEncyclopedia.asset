      title: Ecological Summary
      author: Candentis Acernis (Astral Maple)
    text: "{Covering most available dirt and grass-based terrain on Planet X were
      strange maple-producing trees.} Rescue teams later named them Candentis Acernis.
      \r\n\r\n{Lumoos and other similar species on Planet X} seem specifically drawn
      to foraging, particularly surviving off of plentiful Candentis Acernis production.
      {Researchers noted that a single tree would produce anywhere from 6 to 8 fruits.}
      The fruit produced was observed to be approximately kiwi-sized, and tasted
      much like maple, but are shaped like stars. \r\n\n{Astral Maples seem to be
      very resiliant and are able to live in relatively unpure water, as low as 90%
      purity.} In terms of bacteria and salinity denisities they are also not picky
      as long as the water purity need is met. {Their roots are able to reach 4 tiles
      outwards from their trunk and do the best with at least 9 water tiles available.}
      \n\r\nPh.D. Juno Fornax, with Natura Serva 22, noted that {one prominent variant
      of Astral Maple has been observed in the temperate and grassy Alderson Steppe:
      Candentis Acernis Aurum, also known as Gilded Astral Maple.} This variant maintains
      a year-round golden, yellow foliage instead of its traditional blues, but {produces
      higher quality, less quantity fruit per day than its counterpart.} "

      title: Transport Log

    text: "The first thing I noticed in this part of the ship: those are some really
      gold trees. I asked one of the scientists, Dr. Star, and she explained that
      they are a rare but naturally occurring variant of Astral Maples. {They require
      96% pure water, do not grow in terrain except for dirt and grass, yadda yadda.}
      I had been instructed to not touch any of these trees; now that I\u2019m counting,
      we have about 15. Compared to how many animals on this ship appear to be herbivores,
      I can\u2019t say this looks promising..."

      title: Observation Log Session #1
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "March 26, 3020, 6:00 am\r\nUpon arriving on Planet X, we most noticed
      that there is an abundance of flora in proportion to visible fauna. Dr. Star
      quickly concluded that most, if not all, of these new animals are herbivores.\r\n\r\nMarch
      26, 3020, 11:00 am\r\nThe colors on this planet are...so, so pretty. I almost
      don\u2019t want to go back to Earth.\r\n\r\nMarch 26, 3020, 3:00 pm\r\nI volunteered
      to observe the nearest steppe in range to our landing location. Drone #109bc
      has identified an unusual plant. Moving in to observe.\r\n\r\nMarch 26, 3020,
      3:45 pm\r\nIt\u2019s...real gold. Sending data to the lab to confirm. ...Why
      on Terra would they eat gold leaves?\r\n\r\nMarch 26, 3020, 4:30 pm\r\nAfter
      collecting my thoughts, I returned to base to collect an electron microscope,
      which forms images by using tiny electron beams instead of light waves. This
      particular microscope is calibrated to show detail less than one angstrom apart.
      I think I\u2019ve found something incredibly rare.\r\n"

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "Generalist Candentis Acernis Applicable to Terran Conservation\r\n\r\nCandentis
      Acernis are a species of tree that produces fruit year-round. The fruit are
      approximately kiwi-sized, with a white or pale pink hue. The species shows
      generalist tendencies, meaning that they can tolerate a wide range of habitat
      conditions. Trees were noticeably not present in swamp-like terrain. However,
      in the Alderson Steppe, a unique variant of Candentis Acernis was abundant.
      Natura Serva 22 team scientists rescued approximately five golden variants,
      which produce slightly red-tinted fruit, and 15 regular Candentis Acernis.
      This new species has notable possible implications for genetic modification
      of terran trees. As the tree produces year-round and is a generalist species,
      researchers are currently testing maximizing production rate and applying both
      tendencies to other species in its genus. Perhaps, finally, terrans will have
      a large enough supply to turn to eco-friendly, alternative consumption.\r"
