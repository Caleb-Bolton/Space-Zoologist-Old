      title: Ecological Summary - Ligurio Vermis
      author: 
    text: "The voracious Ligurio Vermis is a species of mammal whose prominent characteristic
      is an elongated snout with a thin tongue. Ligurio Vermis, despite its lengthy
      tongue, has a tube-shaped mouth with lips, but no teeth. Thus preferring softer
      prey and flora for consumption, \r\n\r\nLigurio Vermis appears to require 6-8
      food sources per day. Ligurio Vermis ranges in size between 2.2 and 2.8 meters
      in length, with a correspondingly high requisite of territory and water sources."

    text: "Okay, I know Dr. Star said to be more formal, but Ligurio Vermis is just
      like my college mascot! Their snouts are a bit different, but they are from
      space, so... Anyways.\r\n\r\nLigurio Vermis\u2019 food preference during transportation
      appears to be fruit from Vaccinum Spatium Bacca. Like most other Planet X fauna,
      they also accept Candentis Acernis fruits. Given their overall shape, size,
      and observed behaviors, they align with terran anteater expectations and consume
      ant colonies as well."

      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "April 15, 3020, 9:05 am\r\nLigurio Vermis sighted in the Alderson Steppe.
      No sightings in the Atacail Desert or Pastillion Mountain Range. Unknown habitation
      in Cairgoln Lake and surrounding swamp areas. \r\n\r\nApril 15, 3020, 9:40
      am\r\nObserved a candle of Ligurio Vermis descend upon a cluster of Thalassius
      Succo. Survivors retreated into the main source of Thalassius Succo, which
      appears to be further hidden in rocky terrain impassable by larger creatures.
      No notable interactions with other species thus far."

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "Planet X Fauna\u2019s Unusual Resemblance to Terran Species\r\n\r\nWhile
      terran anteaters are aptly predators to ants, Planet X\u2019s anteater-like
      species, Ligurio Vermis, is a predator to Thalassius Succo, a spider-like species.
      Classifications of Planet X\u2019s flora and fauna reliant on terran classification
      are misleading, and often incorrect. However, their outward physical appearance
      is undeniable. Further research is required to investigate both terran and
      Planet X\u2019s similar species, such as their liquid composition needs and
      space requirements. Ligurio Vermis appears suited to less strict pure water
      and minimal bacteria needs, unlike most other mammals from Planet X."
