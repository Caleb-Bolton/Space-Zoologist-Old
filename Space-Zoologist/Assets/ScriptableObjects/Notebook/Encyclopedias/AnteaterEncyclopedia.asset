      title: Ecological Summary
      author: Ligurio Vermis
    text: "The voracious Ligurio Vermis is a species of mammal whose prominent characteristic
      is an elongated snout with a thin tongue. Dubbed Stroteater, the species has
      a lengthy tongue, a tube-shaped mouth with lips, and no teeth. It thus prefers
      consuming softer prey and flora. \r\n\r\nStroteaters appear to require 6-8
      food sources per day. Ligurio Vermis ranges in size between 2.2 and 2.8 meters
      in length, and requires a correspondingly high volume of personal territory
      and water sources in order to thrive"

    text: "Okay, I know Dr. Star said to be more formal, but these Stroteaters are
      just like my college mascot! Their snouts and vocal chords are a bit different,
      so they can\u2019t Zot like a terran anteater, but they are from space, so...
      Anyways.\r\n\r\nLigurio Vermis\u2019 food preference during transportation
      appears to be fruit from Vaccinum Spatium Bacca. Like most other Planet X fauna,
      they also accept Candentis Acernis fruits. They are similar in shape, size,
      and behavior to terran anteaters -- so much so I almost thought they were terran
      anteaters! I bet they can\u2019t swim, too. They even seem to love eating Planet
      X\u2019s native ant species, too, but hate mushrooms."

      title: Observation Log
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "April 15, 3020, 9:05 am\r\nLigurio Vermis sighted in the Alderson Steppe.
      No sightings in the Atacail Desert. \r\n\r\nApril 15, 3020, 9:40 am\r\nObserved
      a candle of Ligurio Vermis descend upon a cluster of Thalassius Succo. Survivors
      retreated into the main source of Thalassius Succo, which appears to be further
      hidden in rocky terrain impassable by larger creatures. No notable interactions
      with other species thus far."

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Juno Fornax
    text: "Ligurio Vermis\u2019 Resemblance to Terran Species\r\n\r\nWhile terran
      anteaters are aptly predators to ants, Planet X\u2019s anteater-like species,
      Ligurio Vermis, is a predator to Thalassius Succo, a spider-like species. Classifications
      of Planet X\u2019s flora and fauna reliant on terran classification are misleading,
      and often incorrect. Unlike most other mammals we\u2019ve recovered from Planet
      X, Ligurio Vermis appears able to subsist on relatively impure water, able
      to take in as low as 95% pure water. They even seem to be remarkably resistant
      to the effects of drinking from bacterially infected water sources, able to
      drink as high as 2% bacterially infected water. They are also able to handle
      a decent amount of salt, as much as 2%, but won't drink water that has no salt
      in it at all. "
