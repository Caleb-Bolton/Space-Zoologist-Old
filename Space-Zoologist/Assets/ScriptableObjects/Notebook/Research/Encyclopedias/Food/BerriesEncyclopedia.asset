      title: Ecological Summary - Vaccinum Spatium Bacca
      author: 
    text: "Found in clusters, the Vaccinum Spatium Bacca is a colorful highbush producing
      various berries. These spaceberries have been observed as compatible food for
      a wide variety of species. The Vaccinum Spatium Bacca is a deciduous fruiting
      shrub, thus far primarily found in heathlands and acidic soils. As a shallow-rooted
      plant, these bushes skew away from other flora with deeper roots, such as the
      space maple. \r\n\r\nSpaceberries produced vary in size, depending on the health
      of the bush. The berries typically range between red and orange.\r"

      title: Observation Log - J.F. Space Berry Bush Session #3
      author: 
    text: "I think this is the last observation log I\u2019m going to write for this
      specific plant. Dr. Star wanted me to do \u201Cjust one more,\u201D which,
      as we all know, is like ten more. Repetition and replication is important in
      verifying results, but these plants really aren\u2019t that different from
      the typical terran blackberry bush. The fruits are much more...spicy? I have
      no idea why, but that\u2019s a job for the folks in the lab, not here on the
      ground."

      title: Research Abstract with A.S - Under Review
      author: 
    text: "<b>Similar Evolutionary Processes for Genus Vaccinium Across Planets\r</b>\n\r\nVaccinum
      Spatium Bacca, originally termed \u201Cspaceberry bush,\u201D are a species
      of bush that produces fruit year-round. The fruit are approximately blueberry-sized,
      in the red-orange hue range. Comparable to the Terran genus vaccinium, the
      spaceberry bush is a deciduous fruiting shrub found in heathlands and acidic
      soils. As a shallow-rooted plant, it has not been found in rocky or sand-based
      terrain. One bush produces on average between 7 and 10 berries per day. Its
      high production rate is not the only factor that distinguishes this plant from
      terran berry bushes. Natura Serva 22 ecologists are currently researching varying
      flavors produced by Vaccinum Spatium Bacca. 5 spaceberry bushes were preserved
      from twelve separate locations, for a total of 60. Of those, scientists have
      reported varying tastes, from \u201Cspicy,\u201D \u201Cumami,\u201D \u201Csweet,\u201D
      and \u201Ccitrusy.\u201D It is unclear what impacts the flavor and color produced
      by the separate clusters."
