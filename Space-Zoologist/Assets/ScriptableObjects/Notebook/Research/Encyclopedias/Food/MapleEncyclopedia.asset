      title: Ecological Summary - Candentis Acernis
      author: 
    text: "Covering most available fertile land on Planet X were strange maple producing
      trees. Rescue teams later named these space maples Candentis Acernis. The maple
      trees were notably only not present in swamps. \r\n\r\nCattle and other similar
      species on Planet X seem specifically drawn to foraging, particularly surviving
      off of plentiful Candentis Acernis production. Researchers noted that a single
      tree would produce anywhere from five to eight fruits. The fruit produced was
      observed to be approximately kiwi-sized, and tasted much like maple, but are
      shaped like stars. \r\n\r\nPh.D. Jane Fjorster, with Natura Serva 22, noted
      that one prominent variant of space maple has been observed in the temperate
      Alderson Steppe: the golden Candentis Acernis. This variant maintains a year-round
      golden, yellow foliage instead of its traditional blues. Regardless of variant,
      these maples are fast-growing trees that usually reach 18 to 27 meters in height."

      title: Transport Log - B.W. with Candentis Acernis
      author: 
    text: "The first thing I noticed in this part of the ship: those are some really
      gold trees. I asked one of the scientists, Dr. Star, and she explained that
      they are a rare but naturally occurring variant of space maples. I had been
      instructed to not touch any of these trees; now that I\u2019m counting, we
      have about 15. Compared to how many animals on this ship appear to be herbivores,
      I can\u2019t say this looks promising..."

      title: Observation Log - J.F. Space Maple Session #1
      author: 
    text: "March 26, 3020, 6:00 am\r\nUpon arriving on Planet X, we most noticed
      that there is an abundance of flora in proportion to visible fauna. Dr. Star
      quickly concluded that most, if not all, of these new animals are herbivores.
      I don\u2019t know how she got to that conclusion so quickly.\r\n\r\nMarch 26,
      3020, 11:00 am\r\nThe colors on this planet are...so, so pretty. I almost don\u2019t
      want to go back to Earth.\r\n\r\nMarch 26, 3020, 3:00 pm\r\nI volunteered to
      observe the nearest steppe in range to our landing location. Drone #109bc has
      identified an unusual plant. Moving in to observe.\r\n\r\nMarch 26, 3020, 3:45
      pm\r\nIT\u2019S FREAKING GOLD\r\nACTUAL GOLD.\r\nOR. WELL, I\u2019LL SEND IT
      TO THE LAB, BUT IT FEELS LIKE GOLD FLAKES\r\n\r\nMarch 26, 3020, 4:30 pm\r\nAfter
      collecting my thoughts, I returned to base to collect an electron microscope,
      which forms images by using tiny electron beams instead of light waves. This
      particular microscope is calibrated to show detail less than one angstrom apart.
      I hope I\u2019ve found something incredibly rare, man. I want a tree named
      after me...\r"

      title: Research Abstract by J.F. - Under Review
      author: 
    text: "Generalist Candentis Acernis Applicable to Terran Conservation\r\n\r\nCandentis
      Acernis, originally termed \u201Cspace maple,\u201D are a species of tree that
      produces fruit year-round. The fruit are approximately kiwi-sized, with a white
      or pale pink hue. The species shows generalist tendencies, meaning that they
      can tolerate a wide range of habitat conditions. Trees were noticeably not
      present in swamp-like terrain. However, in the Alderson Steppe, a unique variant
      of Candentis Acernis was abundant. Natura Serva 22 team scientists rescued
      approximately five golden variants, which produce slightly red-tinted fruit,
      and 15 regular Candentis Acernis. This new species has notable possible implications
      for genetic modification of Terran trees. As the tree produces year-round and
      is a generalist species, researchers are currently testing maximizing production
      rate and applying both tendencies to other species in its genus. Perhaps, finally,
      Terrans will have a large enough supply to turn to eco-friendly, alternative
      consumption."
