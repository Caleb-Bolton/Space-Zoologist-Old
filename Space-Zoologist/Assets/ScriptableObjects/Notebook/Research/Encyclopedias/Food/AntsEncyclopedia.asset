      title: Ecological Summary - Formica Collis
      author: 
    text: "Similar to terran ants, PlanetX was home to ants over most terrain. Dubbed
      Formica Collis, PlanetX\u2019s ants conform to typical terran ant sizes, ranging
      from 0.75 to 52 millimeters. However, Formica Collis diverge from terran ant
      color patterns, ranging between green and purple.\r\nThe only places lacking
      indigenous ants appeared to be inhospitable arctics and swamps. Ants thrive
      in most ecosystems and may have formed a significant portion of Planet X\u2019s
      terrestrial animal biomass. Formica Collis tend to build complex subterranean
      nests, foraging from local plant and animal life. \r"

      title: Transport Log - B.W. with Formica Collis

    text: "I think these little dudes are changing color? Or they\u2019re moving
      so fast that I\u2019m mixing them up with each other, which is pretty possible.
      There\u2019s not much here to take care of for them. They\u2019ve got some
      leaves, some dead bugs, bunch of water in their terrarium. I bet they\u2019re
      eager to rebuild their nest\u2026 Bugs generally freak me out, but these are
      surprisingly pretty, especially the green ones."

      title: Observation Log - J.F. Ant Colony Session #5
      author: 
    text: "<b>March 28, 3020, 8:00 am\r</b>\nOriginally upon arriving on Planet X,
      we most noticed that there is an abundance of flora in proportion to visible
      fauna, and Dr. Aurora Star concluded that most species are herbivores. One
      notable exception appears to be PlanetX\u2019s ants. Currently, they are transporting
      small pieces from a bird carcass. \r\n\r\n<b>March 28, 3020, 11:00 am\r</b>\nThe
      ants have returned to their nest. Upon approach, the ants scurried inside the
      subterranean safety of their home. The nest appears to align with terran patterns,
      except for a highly voluminous population. Taking samples now.\r\n"

      title: Research Abstract with A.S. - Under Review
      author: 
    text: "<b>Water Stress for Planet X Flora\r</b>\n\r\nIn terran ants, recent studies
      have shown that widespread ant\u2013plant symbiosis increases with water stress.
      Given Natura Serva 22\u2019s focus on repopulation, minimal preliminary research
      of Planet X ant-plant symbiosis has been conducted. Terran trees invest more
      carbon in ants via phloem-feeding scale insects that provide the ants with
      sugars, and the ants provide better defense of the carbon-producing leaves.
      Under water stress, the trees have smaller carbon pools. The degree to which
      water limitation may increase the strength of a carbon-based mutualism is uncertain
      for Planet X plant life. \r"
