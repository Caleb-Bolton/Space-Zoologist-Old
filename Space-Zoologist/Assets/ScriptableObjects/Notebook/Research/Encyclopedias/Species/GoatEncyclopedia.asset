      title: Ecological Summary - CapraX Zeigrun
      author: 
    text: "Rescue teams found strange space goats, later named CapraX Zeigrun, in
      the middle and lower regions of the Pastillion Mountain Range, {where the terrain
      was noted to be a combination of dirt and grass.} \r\n\r\nThe middle and lower
      parts of the Pastillion Mountain Range supported few plant species, the most
      common being space maple trees, Candentis Acernis. Researchers noted that a
      single goat would consume anywhere from five to eight of the maple fruit a
      day. The fruit produced was observed to be approximately kiwi-sized. \r"

      title: Transport Log
      author: Barry Wachmann
    text: "These goats are the cutest thing I have ever seen. They\u2019re freaking
      blue. I mean, what makes a goat blue? Its food? God, I wish I could have seen
      PlanetX before it blew up. Wonder what else was on there\u2026 \r\n\r\nAnyways,
      yeah, transport log notes! At 11:23:60, we ran out of maple fruit. The rest
      is under strict cryofreeze or something. So, instead, they gave us some berries
      they found on-planet. The goats seem to like them, just a little less. I tried
      to give them a mushroom, but the face it made was unhappy, to say the least.
      \r\n\r\nThese things barely eat, though, just like one fruit every four hours.
      Bet I could lose weight if I ate these things.\r"

      title: Observation Log Session #46
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "<b>June 6th, 3020, 6:00 am</b>\r\nLocated at the bottom of the eastern
      edge of the Pastillion Mountain Range, in observation site A. Observation session
      #46 goals: 1) account for the various population sizes migrating and 2) update
      the liquid requirements database. Observation schedule is set to every 30 minutes,
      and will reduce to every 10 minutes when a population has been spotted. \r\n\r\n<b>June
      6th, 3020, 6:30 am</b>\r\nNo signs of goat migration, but the planet\u2019s
      sunrise created flashes of color on the filled basin as it rose behind me.
      I never get tired of watching the maple clusters change color from a dreary
      gray to vibrant purple in 8 hour cycles.\r\n\r\n<b>June 6th, 3020, 7:05 am</b>\r\nI
      observed the first goat population emerge from the now vibrant maple. Total
      of 12 goats were sighted. Observation session #46 aligns with previous log
      data. 10-14 goats appear to be standard population size. 20-30 maple trees
      per herd.\r\n\r\n<b>June 6th, 3020, 7:15 am\r</b>\nA total of 3 different populations
      are currently spread around the perimeter of the lake. On the far left is the
      most recent population observed, with 6 goats total. The herd moved at a comparatively
      sluggish pace. They originated from the south eastern edge of the Pastillion
      Basin, noted for its distinct lack of grasslands. The population features 12
      goats in the middle consuming the lake\u2019s liquid and space maple fruit.
      The population furthest from me features 8 goats, still below the estimated
      average population. There are very few local space maples in their grazing
      area, but they appear to instead be eating some sort of berries. Range of 6-12
      goats per herd may change standard population size estimates.\r\n"

      title: Research Abstract
      author: Dr. Aurora Star
    text: "<b>Population status, threats, and conservation of the CapraX Zeigrun</b>\r\n\r\nThe
      space goat, CapraX Zeigrun, previously resided in the Pastillion Mountain Range
      on Planet X, now extinct. The planet\u2019s destruction has led to ex-situ,
      or off-site, conservation, instead of originally planned in-situ, or on-site,
      restoration. Four space goats are currently in rehabilitation in the international
      nature preservation, Natura Serva 22, under care of a team of Planet X researchers.
      Its original habitat supported grasslands and rocky, dirt mountain terrain.
      Herds of approximately 10-14 goats migrated in an anomalous pattern around
      the basin\u2019s central freshwater lake. The average number of space maples,
      Candentis Acernis, within range of the herd were approximately 20-30. Current
      measures attempt to approximate the Pastillion Mountain Range\u2019s natural
      flora and fauna from rescued species samples. \r"
