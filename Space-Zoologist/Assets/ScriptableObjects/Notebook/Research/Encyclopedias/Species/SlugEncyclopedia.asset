      title: Ecological Summary - Humidum Limax
      author: 
    text: "Planet X\u2019s version of slugs, Humidum Limax, are composed of one large
      stomach muscle which propels their movement. Slugs have aligned with terran
      environmental expectations, but their current eating patterns are varied. Humidum
      Limax are also nocturnal and sensitive to ambient temperature. Birds do not
      appear to be the slug\u2019s predator, so its current predation relationships
      are undetermined.\r"

      title: Transport Log - B.W. with Humidum Limax

    text: "Dr. Star was telling me to be more professional with my note keeping\u2026
      here goes. \r\n\r\nApril 8, 3020 1:13 am\r\nThese are slugs, because snails
      have shells, and these do not have shells. Most of both species live near,
      if not in, water and can survive on land. They seem content in the water tank.\r\n\r\nApril
      8, 3020 5:02 pm\r\nAfter transferring five slugs into a mix of dirt-water terrain
      to test survival, I observed that the slugs were more content in swamp-like
      depths than their original water tank. Further testing required. \r"

      title: Observation Log - A.S. Humidum Limax Session #39
      author: 
    text: "March 27, 3020, 4:00 am\r\nTerran slugs typically eat any and all available
      food sources in their travel path. However, these slugs appear to be targeting
      diving bell spiders present at the surface of Carigoln Lake.\r\n\r\nMarch 27,
      3020, 10:00 am\r\nChanged location to Broree Lake. Less slugs than at Carigoln
      Lake are eating spiders, in favor of the lake\u2019s abundant kelp sources.
      \r\n\r\nMarch 27, 3020, 2:00 pm\r\nChanged location to the Pastillion Mountain
      Range. I have spotted a solitary slug, the only one present in the range. Its
      secretion trail leads to a nearby water source.\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 3020 2:45
      pm\r\nUpon my return to the slug, from a distance, a herd of Eligans Impar
      began grazing. The slug began crawling at an increased pace, only to be eaten
      by one of the herd."

      title: Research Abstract by J.F. - Under Review
      author: 
    text: "Planet X Gastropod Diversity: Extinct or Non-Existent Snails?\r\n\r\nIn
      terran mollusks, snails are averse to slug secretions, causing some difficulties
      with cohabitation. Despite a thorough surface search of Planet X, even in water
      biomes without the presence of slugs, no snails were observed. Due to the planet\u2019s
      destruction, evidence indicating other gastropod groups may only be found through
      researching existing preserved species. Thus far, Humidum Limax, Planet X\u2019s
      most prominent slug species, have exhibited extreme aversion to fruits, another
      deviation from terran gastropods. It is hypothesized that snails were simply
      non-existent on Planet X.\r"
